# NOVA (Neuro-Symbolic, Optimized, Versatile Agent) Implementation

## Overview

NOVA is a neuro-symbolic, optimized, versatile agent framework that unifies core ideas from:
- ReACT (Reason + Act)
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
- LASER (Language-Agnostic SEntence Representations)
- Symbolic Reasoning
- Advanced agentic logic

This implementation provides a robust framework for building autonomous, multilingual, and logically consistent AI solutions.

## Architecture

The NOVA implementation consists of several key components:

### 1. Core Components
- **Agentic Flow Controller**: Manages the overall flow of agent operations
- **Language Normalization**: LASER embeddings for cross-lingual capabilities
- **Symbolic Engine**: Handles knowledge graphs and logical reasoning
- **Tool Interface**: Manages external API and tool interactions

### 2. Key Features
- Neural Reasoning via Chain-of-Thought expansions
- Symbolic Consistency through knowledge graphs and logic rules
- Cross-Lingual Versatility using LASER embeddings
- Tool Interoperability via ReACT-inspired mechanisms
- Adaptive Control with advanced planning and fallback strategies

### 3. Directory Structure
```
src/nova/
├── config/           # Configuration files
├── tools/           # Custom tools and utilities
└── docs/            # Documentation and implementation details
```

## Usage

```python
from nova.crew import NovaCrew

# Initialize NOVA crew
crew = NovaCrew()

# Run with specific task
result = crew.run(
    prompt="Your task prompt here",
    task_type="research|execute|analyze|both"
)
```

## Configuration

The system can be configured through YAML files in the `config` directory:
- `agents.yaml`: Agent definitions and roles
- `tasks.yaml`: Task configurations
- `analysis.yaml`: Analysis and validation rules

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs` directory:
- Implementation Guide
- API Reference
- Vertical-Specific Examples
- Best Practices
