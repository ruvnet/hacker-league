# NOVA Dictionary of Key Terms

## Core Concepts

### Agentic Methodology
A design framework where AI models can autonomously perform tasks by planning, reasoning, and executing actions in dynamic environments. In NOVA, this includes the ability to use tools, validate reasoning, and adapt to different scenarios.

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
A technique prompting language models to articulate step-by-step reasoning before outputting a final answer. NOVA uses CoT to improve transparency and accuracy in decision-making processes.

### LASER (Language-Agnostic SEntence Representations)
A tool providing universal embeddings for multilingual text, enabling cross-lingual search, classification, and alignment. NOVA uses LASER for consistent handling of multiple languages.

### Neuro-Symbolic
An AI approach merging neural networks (statistical pattern recognition) with symbolic logic (explicit rules, ontologies) for interpretable and robust decision-making. NOVA combines both approaches for optimal results.

### ReACT (Reason + Act)
A methodology where models interleave reasoning steps with concrete actions. NOVA extends this by adding validation, fallback mechanisms, and tool integration.

## System Components

### Knowledge Graph
A structured database of facts expressed as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), enabling logical queries and domain-specific reasoning. Used by NOVA's symbolic engine.

### Planner/Controller
The component in NOVA that orchestrates task execution, manages tool usage, and handles error recovery. It ensures efficient scheduling and execution of operations.

### Symbolic Engine
The component responsible for logical reasoning, knowledge graph operations, and consistency checking. It validates decisions against defined rules and constraints.

### Tool Interface
The system that mediates between NOVA and external services (APIs, databases, computational tools). It provides standardized data exchange and error handling.

## Operational Concepts

### Fallback Mechanism
A strategy used when primary methods fail. NOVA implements multiple fallback levels:
- Retry with different parameters
- Alternative tool selection
- Graceful degradation of service

### Multi-Agent Coordination
The ability for multiple specialized NOVA agents to collaborate on complex tasks. Includes:
- Task distribution
- Resource sharing
- Result aggregation

### Progress Tracking
System for monitoring task execution progress, including:
- Step completion
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization

### Validation Framework
A comprehensive system for validating:
- Reasoning steps
- Action execution
- Results accuracy

## Technical Terms

### Action Validation
The process of verifying that proposed actions are:
- Safe to execute
- Have required prerequisites
- Follow defined constraints

### Context Alignment
The process of aligning language embeddings with domain-specific knowledge and requirements. Used in NOVA's language processing.

### Error Recovery
Systematic approach to handling failures:
- Error detection
- Impact assessment
- Recovery strategy selection
- Execution resumption
